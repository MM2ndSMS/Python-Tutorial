# Python-Tutorial
### Python Syntax
print("Hello, Would!")
### Python Indentation
if 6 > 4:
  print("Six is greater than four!")
### Python Variables
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
### Python Comments
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, Wonju!")
print("Hello, Wonju!") #This is a comment
#print("Hello, Wonju!")
print("Goodluck, Friend!")
### Python Multiline Comments
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, Busan!")
"""
This is a comment
written in

print("Hello, Busan!")
### Python Variables
x = 5
y = "SHIN"
print(x)
print(y)

x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
### Casting
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
### Get the Type
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
### Single or Double Quotes?
x = "SHIN"
# is the same as
x = 'SHIN'
### Case-Sensitive
a = 19
A = "Min Sung"
#A will not overwrite a
### Python - Variable Names
myvar = "SHIN"
my_var = "SHIN"
_my_var = "SHIN"
myVar = "SHIN"
MYVAR = "SHIN"
myvar2 = "SHIN"
## Multi Words Variable Names
### Camel Case
myVariableName = "SHIN"
### Pascal Case
MyVariableName = "SHIN"
### Snake Case
my_variable_name = "SHIN"
## Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values
### Many Values to Multiple Variables
x, y, z = "Moka", "Milk", "Coffee"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
### One Value to Multiple Variables
x = y = z = "Moka"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
### Unpack a Collection
fruits = ["Moka", "Milk", "Coffee"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
## Python - Output Variables
### Output Variables
x = "Python is unbelievable"
print(x)

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "unbelievable"
print(x, y, z)

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "unbelievable"
print(x + y + z)

x = 5
y = "SHIN"
print(x, y)
